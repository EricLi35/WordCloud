This Django-based application outputs a wordcloud based on user input, using Python's WordCloud library! A wordcloud is a cluster of words clumped together, where the font size of each individual word is dependent on its frequency within a paragraph. The user can input any paragraph, hit the submit button and will receive an image of the outputted word cloud, and that image is automatically saved to their directory!
